  Checking Build System
  CMake is re-running because C:/Users/ajcra/Desktop/NGCP/CommSerial/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp is out-of-date.
    the file 'C:/Users/ajcra/Desktop/NGCP/CommSerial/CMakeLists.txt'
    is newer than 'C:/Users/ajcra/Desktop/NGCP/CommSerial/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp.depend'
    result='-1'
  CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:29 (if):
    Policy CMP0054 is not set: Only interpret if() arguments as variables or
    keywords when unquoted.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0054" for policy
    details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this
    warning.
  
    Quoted variables like "MSVC" will no longer be dereferenced when the policy
    is set to NEW.  Since the policy is not set the OLD behavior will be used.
  This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
